Phase 1 - application development

1. Database module - Puiu Ana Maria
	- low-level database that is using a xml file to store the information
	- each table and column is defined using a tag, and the actual data that is stored in the database is found between columns tags 
	- the tables defined are: 
		- specialization: detailes about the main areas the candidates can apply to (description, capacity)
		- candidate: detailes about the students that are participating in the admission contest (name, email, grades)
		- repartition: the results of the admission contest; each student has a final score and a admission result (budget-financed / fee payer / rejected) that may be associated or not with a specialization
	- for database operations, each object is serialized/ deserialized, meaning it's transformed into, and from, a representation defined by xml tags  	
		ex: <repartition>
				<candidate_cnp>12345677899</candidate_cnp>
				<final_score>9.3</final_score>
				<allocation>FREE</allocation>
				<specialization_id>1</specialization_id>
			</repartition>
	- database operations defined for all tables:
		- select: retrieval of information based on a search criteria: id, cnp or not; implemented by reading the file line by line and parsing the tags in search of the given parameter
		- insert: the new entry is serialized and added at the end of the file
		- delete: the whole file is rewritten without the object that has to be deleted
		- update: having the object with the updated attributes, the current entry if the database for the object is removed, and then the current object is inserted 


2. Input/output management module - to be added

3. Admission process module - to be added



Phase 2 - unit testing

1. Database module - Puiu Ana Maria
	- unit tests that are verifying:
		- the correctness and completeness of the operations: database operations are executed and are producing the expected results
		- handling of missing data: if data is misisng, defauld values are used 
		- handling of incorrect data: incorrect data is leading to errors 

2. Input/output management module - to be added

3. Admission process module - to be added


Phase 3 - use of assertions

1. Database module - to be added
